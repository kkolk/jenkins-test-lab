/**
 * This script is meant to be executed by a parameterized job in Jenkins and will then create a new agent
 * (slave) as per the parameters. This version of the script creates agents that use the SSH setup on Linux
 * Furthermore it is set up to expect droplet type parameters from a job making servers on DigitalOcean
 *
 * SUGGESTED PAIRED PARAMETERS IN JENKINS (type, name, default values, description):
 *
 * Password - credentialID - <put your desired id here> - Jenkins configured credential to use
 *
 * Note: The credential needs to be in the format produced by running this in the Jenkins script console:
 *
 * com.cloudbees.plugins.credentials.CredentialsProvider.lookupCredentials(
 *        com.cloudbees.plugins.credentials.common.StandardUsernameCredentials.class,
 *        Jenkins.instance, null, null ).each { credential ->
 *    println(credential.id + ": " + credential.description)
 * }
 *
 * Note: The following are meant to be created in the calling job, but could be made for testing
 *
 * String - dropletURL - "agent1.terasology.net" - Use the droplet url as the agent name
 * String - dropletID - "1234567" - By putting the droplet ID in the agent description it is handy later
 * String - dropletIP - "192.168.1.1" - IP of the droplet becomes the target for the SSH call to hit
